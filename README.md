This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.java`, corrects the error by adjusting the loop condition to prevent accessing invalid indices.  This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing in Java.
